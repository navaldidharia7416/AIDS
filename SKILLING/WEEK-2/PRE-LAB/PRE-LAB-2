 Input: X = 4, Y = 3, Z = 2
      Output: {(0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 2), (0, 2)}
Explanation:
    Step 1:- First we will fill the 4 litre jug completely with water.
    Step 2:- Then optimal approach would be to empty water from 4-litre jug into 3-litre  (leaving 1L water in 4L jug and 3L completely full). Hence we got 1L water.
    Step 3:- Now, Empty water from 3L.
    Step 4:- Pour the water from 4L jug into 3L jug Now 4L container is completely empty and 1L water in present in 3L litre jug.
    Step 5:- Fill the 4L jug with water completely again.
    Step 6:- On transfering  water from 4L jug to 3L jug, we will get 2L water in 4L jug which was our required quantity.
